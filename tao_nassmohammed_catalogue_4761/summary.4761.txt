Dust: Calzetti dust model
This model uses the relationship between colour excess E(B-V) and instantaneous star formation rate to determine the
dust content of a galaxy, which is then applied to the galaxy SED using a Calzetti extinction curve

Igm: Fan et al. 2006 model
When the emitted light from a high-redshift galaxy encounters any neutral hydrogen, an absorption line is produced
corresponding to the Lyman-α transition at 1216 Angstroms in the absorber rest-frame.  
  
Following Fan (2006), TAO uses the following equation for the effective optical depth due to Ly-α absorption by
intervening neutral hydrogen:  
  
  
τeff =  
0.85*( (1+z)/5 )4.3 , z < 5.5  
0.15045*( (1+z)/5 )10.9, z >= 5.5
